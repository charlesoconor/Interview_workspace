I'll make it easy for today (mostly because I didn't get a chance to prepare). Two parts:
1. Read up on the following data structures and algorithms. Make sure you can explain how they work in plain English, practice in front of mirror if necessary, or find a buddy:
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- MST finding algorithms
- Heaps
- Prefix trees
- Binary search trees (and what balancing means. Don't need to know specific balancing schemes)
- Hash maps (hash functions, collision handling, rehashing, amortized complexity)
2. Write code (on paper!) for the following: 
- A heap
- Merge two sorted lists
